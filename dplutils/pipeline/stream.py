    arbitrary pipeline graphs with branches, multiple inputs and outputs. By
    default, for each run, it generates a indefinite stream of input dataframes
    tagged with a monotonically incrementing batch id.

    Args:
        max_batches: maximum number of batches from the source generator to feed
          to the input task(s). Default is None, which means either exhaust the
          source generator or run indefinitely.

          dataframes. The yielded dataframes are assumed to be a single row, in
          which case input task batching will be honored.
